# Implementation of Structure Graph Transformer
This repository follow structure of [SAN](https://github.com/DevinKreuzer/SAN).

## TODO:
- [x] Add graph transformer layer and nets.

- [ ] Experiment on other datasets:
  - [x] Node classification: Cora, CiteSeer, CLUSTER, Reddit, MUTAGD, PubMed
  - [ ] Link prediction: AmazonCoBuyComputer, Reddit, MovieLens
  - [ ] Graph classification: SBMs, CIFAR10, CIFAR100, MNIST

- [ ] Add some baselines:
  - [ ] SAT
  - [X] SAN
  - [ ] GAT
  - [ ] DeeperGCN
  - [ ] GPS
  - [ ] Performer
  - [X] GCN
  - [ ] GCN with skip-conection

[x] Add storage experiment results for comparison (ex: save npy loss).
